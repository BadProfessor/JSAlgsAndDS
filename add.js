// Implement addition

// 2. What are the inputs that go into the problem
// ints?
// floats?
// what about string for large numbers?

// 3. What are the outputs that should come form the solution to the problem?
// int? float? string?

// 4. Can the outputs be determinded from the inputs? In other words, do I have enough information to  solve the problem?

// 5. How should I label the important pieces of data that are a part of the problem?
